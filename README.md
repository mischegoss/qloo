# LumiCue - AI-Powered Cultural Intelligence for Memory Care

## The Story of LumiCue

At the end of her life, finding meaningful connection with my Grandmother was difficult and the silence between us was painful for both of us. We both sought out connection, but it was often elusive.

It turns out, I was not alone. In America, 12 million caregivers provide unpaid care for those with dementia at home (Alzheimer's Association, 2024). And that number is expected to grow. By 2050, the number of people living with dementia could exceed 152 million (Alzheimer's Association, 2024).

The inspiration for LumiCue came from recognizing the power of a tool that can make personalized suggestions could help bridge the communication gap.

**LumiCue is an AI-powered app that uses Qloo's Taste AI to help caregivers and those they care for spark meaningful encounters.** By combining cultural intelligence with personalized recommendations, LumiCue transforms everyday moments into sparks of connection.

When AI works to improve all lives, technology is at its best. And that is the power of LumiCue.

## Project Architecture

LumiCue consists of two main components working together to deliver culturally intelligent memory care solutions:

### üé® Frontend Application

**React-based user interface for caregivers and memory care patients**

The LumiCue frontend is an AI-powered cultural intelligence solution designed to help those with memory loss or trouble communicating connect with their caregivers. The app creates culturally relevant, personalized curated conversation starters that engage the senses and feature music, recipes, photos, and stories tailored to the individual.

**Repository**: [LumiCue Frontend](https://github.com/your-username/lumicue-frontend)

**Core Features:**

- **Cultural Intelligence**: Uses Qloo's API to generate culturally relevant content recommendations
- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Leverages Google Gemini AI for content generation and photo analysis
- **Memory Care Focus**: Specifically designed to stimulate memories and provide conversation starters for elderly care
- **Multi-Modal Content**: Combines music (with YouTube integration), recipes, photos, and nostalgia news
- **Feedback System**: Collects user preferences to improve future recommendations
- **Demo Mode**: Showcases the AI pipeline with real-time processing visualization

**Technology Stack:**

- React 18.2.0 with functional components and hooks
- Tailwind CSS 3.3.0 with custom brand colors
- Axios 1.6.0 for API communication

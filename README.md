# Spark Meaningful Connections with Those with Memory Loss with Qloo

## The Story of LumiCue

At the end of her life, finding meaningful connection with my Grandmother was difficult and the silence between us was painful for both of us. We both sought out connection, but it was often elusive.

It turns out, I was not alone. In America, 12 million caregivers provide unpaid care for those with dementia at home (Alzheimer's Association, 2024). And that number is expected to grow. By 2050, the number of people living with dementia could exceed 152 million (Alzheimer's Association, 2024).

The inspiration for LumiCue came from recognizing the power of a tool that can make personalized encounters with AI could help bridge the communication gap.

**LumiCue is an AI-powered app that uses Qloo's Taste AI to help caregivers and those they care for spark meaningful encounters.** By combining cultural intelligence with personalized recommendations, LumiCue transforms everyday moments into sparks of connection.

## Project Architecture

LumiCue consists of two main components working together to deliver culturally intelligent memory care solutions:

### ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Application

**React-based user interface for caregivers and memory care patients**

The LumiCue frontend is an AI-powered cultural intelligence solution designed to help those with memory loss or trouble communicating connect with their caregivers. The app creates culturally relevant, personalized curated conversation starters that engage the senses and feature music, recipes, photos, and stories tailored to the individual.

**Frontend Information**: [LumiCue Frontend README](https://github.com/mischegoss/qloo/blob/main/frontend/README.md)

**Core Features:**

- **Memory Care Focus**: Specifically designed to engage senses and stimulate memories for those with memory loss
- **Multi-Modal Content**: Combines music (with YouTube integration), recipes, photos, and nostalgia news to allow caregivers to choose which encounters works best
- **Feedback System**: Collects user preferences to improve future recommendations
- **Demo Mode**: Showcases the AI pipeline with real-time processing visualization

**Technology Stack:**

- React 18.2.0 
- Tailwind CSS 3.3.0 
- Axios 1.6.0 
- Lucide React 0.263.1

### ðŸ¤– Backend API

**8-agent AI processing pipeline powered by cultural intelligence**

LumiCue Backend is a sophisticated 8-agent AI processing pipeline that powers the cultural intelligence behind LumiCue's personalized memory care recommendations. The API orchestrates multiple AI services to generate culturally relevant, personalized content while maintaining strict data privacy and anonymization protocols.
